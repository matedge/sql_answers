Who checked out the book 'The Hobbitâ€™?

SELECT * FROM member WHERE id = ( SELECT id FROM book WHERE title = "The Hobbit" );


How many people have not checked out anything?

SELECT COUNT (*) FROM member WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT member_id FROM checkout_item);

What books and movies aren't checked out?

SELECT title FROM book WHERE book.id NOT IN (SELECT book_id FROM checkout_item WHERE book_id IS NOT NULL);

Add the book 'The Pragmatic Programmer', and add yourself as a member. Check out 'The Pragmatic Programmer'. Use your query from question 1 to verify that you have checked it out. Also, provide the SQL used to update the database.

INSERT INTO book VALUES (11, "The Pragmatic Programmer");
INSERT INTO member VALUES (43, "Matthew Edge");
INSERT INTO checkout_item VALUES (43, 11, NULL);

Who has checked out more that 1 item?
Tip: Research the GROUP BY syntax.

SELECT member_id, COUNT(*)
FROM checkout_item
GROUP BY member_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
